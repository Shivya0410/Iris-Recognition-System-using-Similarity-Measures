# Iris-Recognition-System-using-Similarity-Measures
This project aims to identify individuals based on their iris using image processing techniques. Given an image of the eyes, it can be used to validate the identity of the individual.

# Similarity Techniques Used
There are 3 broad comparing techniques used: Norm distance (less implies closer), Hamming Distance (less implies closer) and Consine similarity (more implies closer). There is also an option to have lfsr encryption or not. So, in total, there are 6 possibilities to run the code:
